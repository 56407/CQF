    \section{Caplet pricing with HJM
model}\label{caplet-pricing-with-hjm-model}

    This report summarises the results of Question 5 regarding the pricing
of a \textbf{caplet option} written on 6M LIBOR starting 6 months from
today using the formula:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:payoff}
 DF_{OIS}(0, 1) \times \max (L(0;, 0.5, 1) - K, 0) \times \tau \times N
 \end{equation}

with the following parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Strike (agreed rate) \(K = 3.5\%\)
\item
  Notional \(N = 100,000\)
\item
  Tenor \(\tau = 0.5\)
\item
  Discount factor $ DF_{OIS}(0, 1) = 0.996$ taken from a curve
  built from traded OIS swaps
\end{itemize}

    \subsection{Monte Carlo}\label{monte-carlo}

The was done using {\bf Python 2.7} and the code has been attached separately (in the CQF portal exam submission documents).

    For the Monte Carlo simulation the following parameters were used:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Time step \(dt = 0.01\)
\item
  Number of simulations \(I = 6,000\)
\item
  The drift and volatilities of the forward rate were taken from the
  `HJM Model - MC - Caplet v2.xlsm' spreadsheet
\item
  The initial value for the forward rate \(f(t=0, \tau)\) was taken as the
  last row in `HJM Model - PCA.xlsm'
\item
  The random number generator used is python's numpy standard normal
  random number generator (`np.random.standard\_normal') which draws samples from the standard normal distribution (mean=0, stdev=1)
  \item The antithetic variance reduction technique is used to increase the accuracy of the caplet price at minimal computational cost
\end{itemize}

To obtain an expectation of Libor rate in the future
\(L(t; T_i, T_{i+1})\), the forward rate is selected from the corresponding
tenor column \(\tau = T_{i+1} - T_i\) of the HJM output, for the correct simulated time \(t\). We then convert to Libor rate using \(L = m(e^{f/m}-1)\) where $m$ is the compounding
frequency per year.

For the caplet option written on 6M Libor starting 6 months from today this means:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(T_i = 0.5\) (6 months Libor)
\item
  \(T_{i+1} = 1.0\) (cashflow paid)
  \item
Hence \(\tau = T_{i+1} - T_i =0.5\)
\item   \(m = 1/\tau = 1/0.5 = 2.0\)

\end{itemize}

Hence, for each MC simulation we look for the forward rate \(f(0; \tau=0.5)\) and plug this into equation (\ref{eq:payoff})
above. 

\newpage

After 6,000 simulations, the caplet price with the above parameters converges to:


    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
	Caplet price is:
	Std. MC = 472.068922926 (0.144284561179)
	Antithetic MC = 472.763692789 (0.175699863066)
	Average = 472.416307857 (0.0199682961394)
    \end{Verbatim}
where in brackets we see the MC error from the number of simulations (std/sqrt($N$))
    \subsubsection{Convergence diagram}\label{convergence-diagram}

 

    \begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={1.1\linewidth}{1.2\paperheight}}{HJM_caplet_pricing_v2_files/caplet_6000_MC_fixed}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    The figure shows in blue the standard MC result and it's antithetic
in green. They appear to be roughly the mirror image of each other about their average (the variance-corrected result).   The caplet prices without the variance correction show robustness only after  $\sim 3,500$
simulations, where they both appear converge to the average. The variance reduction therefore
has a dramatic effect in reducing the simulation error even at early stages of the simulation. If this was the only source of error, one could get a very good estimate
of the caplet price with just under $\sim 500$ simulations using the variance reduction technique, which would result in significantly faster computational times. However, MC integration has additional sources of error.

\subsubsection{Sources of error}
There are two main sources of error in the MC:
\begin{itemize}
\item Simulation error: this is because we are only simulating a finite number of realizations (possible paths). As discussed, this is calculated as $\sigma_N/\sqrt(N)$ where $\sigma_N$ is the standard deviation of the sample, which is a good approximation as $N \to \infty $

\item Time step error: an error is introduced by the step size $dt$ by virtue of the discrete approximation to continuous events. Given the HJM model SDE to model the forward rate, this error is $\mathcal O( dt ) $ (although this could perhaps be reduced by adding a second order term like in the Milstein scheme)

\item Other sources of error come from for example using a PCA model to calculate the volatility and having used only the 3 largest eigenvalues 

\end{itemize}

    "Also known as 'generalised linear model', it generalises linear regression to multiple input variables (regressors) and $n$ observations. It  is best expressed in matrix form as:\n",

    "There is an extension to the test called the **Augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller test (ADF)**, which removes autocorrelation effects by including lagged difference terms $\\phi_p \\Delta Y_{t-p}$.  The optimal lag oder could then be determined from the information criteria (see above). \n",
